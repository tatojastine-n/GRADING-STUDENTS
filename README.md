# GRADING-STUDENTS
This program adjusts student grades based on certain rules: grades below 38 stay the same, while grades 38 or higher are rounded up to the nearest multiple of 5 if they are within 3 points of it. The `gradingStudents` function goes through each grade in the list and produces a new list with the updated results.
